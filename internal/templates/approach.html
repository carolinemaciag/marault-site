     APPROACH — INTRO
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <p class="approach-lead">
      At Marault Intelligence, analytics is not treated as a collection of dashboards,
      models, or tools. It is treated as a discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is grounded in advanced statistical thinking, machine learning,
      forecasting, and decision science — informed by formal graduate-level training
      in data science at <strong>Northwestern University</strong> and applied through
      real-world business contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every engagement is designed to reduce uncertainty around decisions that matter.

<!-- =========================
     DECISION-FIRST
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section approach-alt">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <h2>A Decision-First Mindset</h2>

    <p>
      We begin with the decision — not the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before any analysis is performed, we work with clients to explicitly define the
      decision that must be made, the constraints under which it must be made, and the
      outcomes that determine success.
    </p>

    <p>
      This framing guides every downstream choice, from metric definition and data
      preparation to model selection and evaluation. By anchoring analysis to decisions
      early, we ensure analytical effort is aligned with business impact rather than
      technical novelty.

<!-- =========================
     ANALYTICAL RIGOR
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <h2>Analytical Rigor, Applied Appropriately</h2>

    <p>
      Our methodology draws from a broad range of analytical techniques, including
      statistical modeling, machine learning, time series analysis, forecasting,
      segmentation, and scenario modeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The techniques themselves are not the point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Models are evaluated not only for predictive performance, but for stability over
      time, interpretability for decision-makers, sensitivity to assumptions, and
      usefulness in guiding action.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where uncertainty is material, we quantify it explicitly and surface trade-offs
      rather than hiding them behind single-point estimates.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- =========================
     INSIGHT
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section approach-alt">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <h2>From Analysis to Insight</h2>

    <p>
      Analytical output is only valuable when it can be interpreted correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      We place deliberate emphasis on validating assumptions, testing robustness and
      sensitivity, distinguishing signal from noise, and translating results into
      clear, opinionated insight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clients do not receive raw analysis alone. They receive clear conclusions —
      what to watch, what is broken, what is driving outcomes, and what is likely to
      happen if no action is taken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Insight, not output, is the core product.
    </p>

<!-- =========================
     SEQUENCING
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <h2>Sequencing Matters</h2>

    <p>
      Advanced analytics only adds value when foundational conditions are in place.
    </p>

    <p>
      We intentionally sequence work to ensure metrics reflect what actually matters,
      data is clean and trusted, and there is shared understanding across stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only then do more complex analytical techniques meaningfully improve decision
      quality. This discipline protects credibility, builds trust, and ensures later
      analysis is actionable rather than theoretical.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- =========================
     ENGAGEMENT
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section approach-alt">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <h2>A Disciplined Engagement Experience</h2>

    <p>
      Our engagements are structured by design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clients experience clear scope and objectives, defined timelines, focused
      analytical effort, and direct, decision-oriented conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This structure minimizes noise, prevents scope creep, and allows organizations
      to move forward with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outcome is not more data — it is better judgment.

<!-- =========================
     CONCLUSION
========================= -->
<section class="approach-section approach-final">
  <div class="approach-container">
    <h2>Confidence in Action</h2>

    <p>
      Ultimately, the Marault Approach is about enabling confident action.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clients gain trust in their numbers, clarity around what matters, visibility into
      trade-offs and risk, and confidence in planning and decision-making.
    </p>

    <p class="approach-closing">
      Clarity in analysis enables confidence in action — when analytics is treated
      as a discipline.
