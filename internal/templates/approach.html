        At Marault Intelligence, analytics is not treated as a collection of dashboards,
        models, or tools. It is treated as a discipline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work is grounded in advanced statistical thinking, machine learning,
        forecasting, and decision science — informed by formal graduate-level training
        in data science at <strong>Northwestern University</strong> and applied through
        real-world business contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every engagement is designed to reduce uncertainty around decisions that matter.

      <h2>A Decision-First Mindset</h2>

      <p>We begin with the decision — not the data.</p>

      <p>
        Before any analysis is performed, we work with clients to explicitly define the
        decision that must be made, the constraints under which it must be made, and the
        outcomes that determine success.
      </p>

      <p>
        This framing guides every downstream choice, from metric definition and data
        preparation to model selection and evaluation.

      <h2>Analytical Rigor, Applied Appropriately</h2>

      <p>
        Our methodology draws from statistical modeling, machine learning, time-series
        analysis, forecasting, segmentation, and scenario modeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Models are evaluated not only for predictive performance, but for stability,
        interpretability, sensitivity to assumptions, and usefulness in guiding action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where uncertainty is material, we quantify it explicitly rather than hiding it
        behind single-point estimates.

      <h2>From Analysis to Insight</h2>

      <p>
        Analytical output is only valuable when it can be interpreted correctly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clients receive clear conclusions — what matters, what is driving outcomes,
        and what is likely to happen if no action is taken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Insight, not output, is the core product.

      <p>
        Advanced analytics only adds value when foundational conditions are in place.

      <p>
        We intentionally sequence work to ensure data is trusted, metrics reflect what
        matters, and stakeholders are aligned.
