    <h2>Founder-Led by Design</h2>

    <div class="panel-divider"></div>

    <p>
      Marault Intelligence is intentionally founder-led. Clients work directly
      with senior leadership throughout every engagement — from problem framing
      and scope definition to final decision support.
    </p>

    <p>
      This structure ensures analytical rigor is never separated from accountability.
      Engagements remain tightly scoped, sequenced with intention, and grounded
      in the realities of executive decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our shared graduate training in data science at Northwestern University
      informs a disciplined, methodical approach — while our partnership ensures
      analytics are delivered with clarity, precision, and purpose.
